This is a small script to handle uploading a set of files to (Plunker)[http://plnkr.co] and keep them in sync

You need to get you GitHub token for Plunker. I did this by using chrome to inspect what I post after logging in.  There is probably a better way to handle this - if you can figure it out - let me know :)

You need to create a file ~/.plunk_it  with just the bare token

After that you should be able to run the command on any directory you want
